# SurfaceDefectDetection-using-Machine-Vision

The project consists of three files which are used for defect identification and localization:
1. batch_processing.py: this contains the model and code for batch processing of data that can handle large datasets
2. MY_Generator.py: this file consists of the file format in which the input and label files are being picked up for processing
3. predict.py: this file contains a preliminary code to load model and predict its outcome for defect localization


Implementation of this Paper :- http://erk.fe.uni-lj.si/2017/papers/racki(towards_surface).pdf is done in the file fccn.py.
